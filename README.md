# Reinforcement-Learning-Agent-Escape-the-Castle

🏰 Escape the Castle: Reinforcement Learning Agent
This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms to solve Escape the Castle, a grid-based survival game inspired by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The player must navigate a 5×5 grid, avoid hidden guards, and reach the goal while managing health and decision-making under uncertainty.

🔍 Techniques Used
Model-Based Monte Carlo (MBMC): Estimated outcome probabilities (e.g. chance of defeating guards) through environment sampling.

Model-Free Monte Carlo (Q-Learning): Trained an agent using an ε-greedy strategy with dynamic learning rates and reward-based updates.

Dimensionality Reduction: For visualizing state representations (if applicable — e.g. PCA/t-SNE).

MDP Simulation: Designed a state-action-reward structure with stochastic transitions and partial observability.
